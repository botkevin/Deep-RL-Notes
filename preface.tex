This is a compilation of notes from UC Berkeley's CS 285 (formerly CS 294-112) taught by Professor Sergey Levine. The notes are based on Fall 2018, Fall 2019, and Fall 2020 offerings of the course. The author is currently a EECS student at UC Berkeley, and the readers are welcome to contact the author via \href{mailto:harryhzhang@berkeley.edu}{harryhzhang@berkeley.edu}.

The notes assume the reader have some familiarity with key concepts such as machine learning, neural networks, Markov Decision Process (MDP), and optimal control.
